"""
This module holds all the computations that are done with costing data. This
includes climate zone requirements (ASHRAE data), material statistics (also
ASHRAE data), and material cost data (Reeds Construction data). The Reeds data
is heavily post-processed; the original data and the post-processing code can't
be included for legal reasons. These models basically hold the minimum data
pre-computed from Reeds data that green primer uses to make its calculations.
