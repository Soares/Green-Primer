Green Primer project manual
Nate Soares

INSTALL:

Green Primer is set up according to django conventions. To learn more about
django conventions, see the documentation at djangoproject.com, it is extensive
and well written. In order to install and test Green Primer, you'll need to take
the following steps on a unix system:

1. Make sure that all the python dependancies are installed (see below)
2. Make sure that PostgreSQL version 8 or higher is installed.
    (as long as the python postgresql_psycopg2 bindings work with you
     PostgreSQL database, you'll be fine)
2. Create a database and a user with permissions on that database
    $ sudo su postgres
    $ psql
    $> create database greenprimer;
    $> grant all on database greenprimer to username;
3. Edit greenprimer/settings.py. If the database user's username is different
   than your current username, you'll need to add a 'USER' field to the
   'default' database in the DATABASES setting. For example, if you are logged
   in as 'foo' but your database user is named 'bar', you'll need to add the
   line
   
   'USER': 'bar',

   after the line
   
   'ENGINE': 'postgresql_psycopg2',

   to correctly set your database user.
4. Add a 'restricted/' directory to the greenprimer/ directory. This directory
    will hold sensitive (non version controlled) data.
5. Add an empty '__init__.py' file to restricted/
6. Add a 'settings.py' file to restricted, with the following content:

    SECRET_KEY = 'A fifty character random string in single quotes. '
    DATABASE_PASSWORDS = {'default': "your user's database password"}

    with a secret key of your chosing and the database password for your database
    user.
7. Go to the root greenprimer directory and run "manage.py runserver"

Green primer will now be accessible at http://localhost:8000/.

Keep in mind that this is a test sever and should not be used for production.
If you want to use Green Primer in production, please read djangoproject.com's
documentation on deploying django projects. I would suggest an nginx or apache
server working in tandem with a static file server.


DEPENDENCIES

All of Green Primer's third party javascript libraries can be found in
greenprimer/static. Some of these (jquery ui in particular) have been patched
for Green Primer's use. It is strongly suggested that you use the versions in
the code base instead of installing versions from online. These third party
libraries include:

Green Primer requires Python 2.7, which can be found at the following url:
http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/

Green Primer runs on a patched version of django with a number of personal
customizations. While the standard django 1.3 release will likely work with
green primer, the specific django used can be found at the following url:

http://github.com/Soares/django/tree/Soares/greenprimer

The official django page is at http://djangoproject.com. Numerous extensions and
utilities such as debug toolbars, sentry, and south can be installed and
turned on in the settings.py file at your discretion, but are not necessary to
make Green Primer work.

The following python modules are necessary for the operation of Green Primer:

module                  version             use                                 location
=============================================================================================================================
hisp                    1.1.0a1     alternate html syntax               (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hisp)
mediagenerator          >=1.8.0     compress and serve static files     (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-mediagenerator)
postgresql_psycopg2     >=2.0       python database bindings            (http://initd.org/psycopg/)

Note that the hisp library was developed in tandem with (and indeed, for)
Green Primer as an alternate way of creating html templates. This code was
originally part of Green Primer, but was split off into a separate library.
The library can be downloaded off of the python package index at the url above,
and the code can be accessed at the following url:
